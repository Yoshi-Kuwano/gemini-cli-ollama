# Gemini CLI Ollama Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the evolution of the Gemini CLI from its initial commit to its current state, highlighting major architectural changes, feature additions, and improvements made throughout development.

## Initial State (Commit: add233c)

The project started as a basic Gemini Code CLI with:

- Simple CLI structure in `packages/cli`
- Basic tools: edit, glob, grep, ls, read-file, terminal, write-file
- Google AI Studio integration only
- Minimal configuration options
- Basic UI with limited theming

## Major Development Milestones

### 1. Architecture Transformation

**From**: Single package structure  
**To**: Monorepo with clear separation of concerns

- `packages/cli` - React/Ink-based terminal UI
- `packages/core` - Business logic, API clients, and tools

Key improvements:

- Introduced `BaseTool` abstract class for consistent tool implementation
- Clear separation between UI components and business logic
- Modular design allowing easy extension

### 2. Ollama Integration (Major Feature)

Added support for local AI models through Ollama:

- **Models supported**: qwen3:1.7b, gemma2:2b, phi3:3.8b, codellama:7b
- **Configuration**: Customizable Ollama host address
- **Privacy focus**: Local execution without cloud dependencies
- **Model switching**: Easy selection between different Ollama models

Key files added:

- `packages/core/src/ollama/ollamaContentGenerator.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/ui/components/OllamaModelSelector.tsx`
- `OLLAMA_SETUP.md` documentation

### 3. Multi-Provider Support

Expanded from Google AI Studio only to:

- **Google AI Studio** (original)
- **Vertex AI** (enterprise Google Cloud)
- **Ollama** (local models)

Features:

- `/auth` command to switch between providers
- Provider-specific privacy notices
- Different authentication flows per provider

### 4. Enhanced Tool System

**Original tools**: edit, glob, grep, ls, read-file, terminal, write-file

**New tools added**:

- `web-fetch` - Analyze web content
- `web-search` - Google Search grounding capability
- `memory-tool` - Context retention across sessions
- `read-many-files` - Efficient multi-file reading
- `shell` - Enhanced terminal with safety restrictions
- `mcp-tool` - Model Context Protocol support

**Tool improvements**:

- Modifiable tools that can update their output
- Better error handling and validation
- Sandboxing support for security

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements

**Themes**: Added 14+ color themes

- Default (light/dark)
- Dracula
- GitHub (light/dark)
- Ayu (light/dark)
- Atom One Dark
- And more...

**New UI features**:

- Previous user input highlighting
- Model stats display (`/stats` command)
- Session summary display
- Auto-accept indicator
- Loading phrases and animations
- Privacy screens per provider

### 6. Configuration System

**Before**: Basic environment variables

**After**: Comprehensive configuration

- User settings: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Workspace settings: `<project>/.gemini/settings.json`
- Environment variable support
- Sandbox configuration
- MCP server configuration

### 7. Security and Sandboxing

Added multiple sandboxing options:

- Container-based (Docker/Podman)
- macOS sandbox profiles (permissive/restrictive)
- Tool-specific restrictions
- Proxy support for corporate environments

### 8. Testing and Quality

**Testing framework**: Migrated to Vitest

- Comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests with sandbox variants
- E2E testing suite
- Coverage reporting

**Quality tools**:

- ESLint with custom rules
- Prettier formatting
- TypeScript strict mode
- Preflight check script

### 9. Documentation

Added extensive documentation:

- Architecture overview
- Authentication guide
- CLI commands reference
- Tool documentation
- Theme gallery
- Contributing guidelines
- CLAUDE.md for AI assistance

### 10. Build and Deployment

**Build system improvements**:

- esbuild for fast bundling
- NPM workspaces for monorepo
- Automated release scripts
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Docker containerization

## Key Technical Improvements

### Performance

- Flash model fallback for faster responses
- Parallel tool execution
- Efficient file operations with streaming
- LRU caching for web fetches

### Developer Experience

- VS Code integration
- Neovim support
- React DevTools in development
- Comprehensive error messages
- Debug logging options

### Telemetry and Analytics

- Clearcut logger integration
- Event tracking
- Privacy-respecting metrics
- Usage statistics

## Recent Updates (Latest Commits)

### No Proxy Configuration (3e58a34)

- Better handling of corporate proxy settings

### README Updates (f5d9c07, 6c1fb19)

- Updated documentation for Ollama setup
- Clarified configuration options
- Added troubleshooting guides

### Ollama Host Selection (2417977)

- Made Ollama host address configurable
- Support for remote Ollama instances
- Better error handling for connection issues

### TODO Management (090beef)

- Created TODO.md for tracking future improvements
- Organized development priorities

## Summary

The Gemini CLI has evolved from a basic Google AI Studio client to a comprehensive, multi-provider AI workflow tool. Key achievements include:

1. **Flexibility**: Support for cloud and local AI models
2. **Security**: Multiple sandboxing options
3. **Extensibility**: MCP protocol support
4. **Developer-friendly**: Comprehensive testing and documentation
5. **Production-ready**: Enterprise features like proxy support and telemetry

The addition of Ollama support represents a significant milestone, enabling users to run AI models locally without cloud dependencies, while maintaining the same powerful interface and tool ecosystem.
